Welcome to the **BuffTeks Commit Ritual** — a digital rite of passage for new members of the **BuffTeks Student Organization** at **West Texas A&M University**.  

This interactive CLI (Command Line Interface) experience teaches you how to use **Git** and **GitHub** while earning your place in the official **BuffTeks Hall of Fame** 🏆.  

Every new member’s name is etched into this README — forever part of our shared developer legacy.

## ⚙️ What Is This?

The **Commit Ritual** is a hands-on onboarding application that simulates real-world software development practices.  
It’s built with ❤️ using **Python**, **Rich**, and **GitHub’s API**, combining education with a BuffTeks experience.

🧠 Learn:
- How to use **version control** (Git + GitHub)
- How to **branch, commit, and push**
- How to collaborate and **merge your work safely**
- How automation can update live documentation (like this one!)
